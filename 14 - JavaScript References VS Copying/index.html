    <title>JS Reference VS Copy</title>

    <p><em>Psst: have a look at the JavaScript Console</em> üíÅ</p>
    <p>
      This exercise was just to practice different ways of making Objects and
      Arrays copies (and what's different from a reference)
    </p>
    <script>
      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2);
      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2);

      let name = "amande";
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2);
      name = "dine";
      console.log(name, name2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      console.log(players, team);

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[2] = "Steph";
      console.log({ players, team2 });

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[3] = "Bob";
      console.log({ players, team3 });

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[1] = "Jame";
      console.log({ players, team4 });

      // or

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[0] = "Toto";
      console.log({ players, team5 });

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(person, captain);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { name: "Charles" });
      console.log(person, cap2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      cap3 = { ...person, name: "Toto", shipName: "Diamond" };
      console.log(person, cap3);

      // Things to note - All those methods are only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
      // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const amande = {
        name: "Dine",
        age: 33,
        social: {
          twitter: "@dine",
          facebook: "dine_kyoto"
        }
      };

      // If we do => Object.assign({}, amande) OR const dev3 = { ...amande };
      // dev2.social.twitter = @coconatsu, the original amande object will also be modified.
      // One way to avoid that:

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(amande));

      dev2.social.twitter = "@amande_dev";

      console.log(amande, dev2);
